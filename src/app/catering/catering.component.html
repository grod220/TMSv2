                    <p>Isabella is the best!  I have used her services for both professional and personal events.  Her food is spectacular, her service is impeccable, and she makes all of the guests feel as if they were in her home.  Isabella’s Bella Cucina is a family business and her husband, Jeff, is a great part of the team.  They are wonderful people who make you feel as if your event is the most important event in </p>

                    <p>I run seminars for high level doctors to learn nutrition. My job is to teach them about the quality of food and the important role it plays in every day health.

                    <p>Mary and I have enjoyed entertaining in our home for many years but wanted to have a ” very special” evening for the key management team I work with.  We asked Isabella to not only create wonderful food but also a wonderful experience which included a cooking demonstration.
